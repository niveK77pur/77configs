== About

My configuration files. Installed by {f-install}[placing symlinks].

* `bin` contains my user created scripts to go under `~/bin`
* `config` contains the config files to go under `~/.config`
* `home` contains config files which live under `$HOME`

== NeoVim

There is a {f-nvim}[config directory for Neovim] in this repository, but it does not reflect my {u-nvim}[main Neovim configuration]. The directory found here merely provides a fallback vimscript config which reads the `~/.vim` Vim configuration. That way, you have the same configuration also directly work in Neovim. Be sure to rename the file to as `init.vim` (i.e. remove the leading `.`) for it to take effect.
