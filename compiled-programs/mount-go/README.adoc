= Helper utility to (un)mount devices

This tool is a rewrite of {mount-sh}[this old bash script] for purposes of getting more familiar with {golang}[Go].

Running the code in the terminal will prompt to select one device to (un)mount. If not run in a terminal, it asks the user to select a device using {dmenu}[dmenu] on X11.

NOTE: The wayland side has not been tackled yet.

== Mounting

USB devices are mounted using {udisksctl-man}[`udisksctl`].

NOTE: MTP is not implemented yet.

CAUTION: The devices mounted as your root, home and so on are also listed.
